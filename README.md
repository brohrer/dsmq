# Dead Simple Message Queue

## What it does

Part mail room, part bulletin board, dsmq is a central location for sharing messages
between processes, even when they are running on computers scattered around the world.

Its defining characteristic is its bare-bones simplicity.

## How to use it

### Install

```bash
pip install dsmq
```
### Create a dsmq server

As in `src/dsmq/example_server.py`

```python
from dsmq import dsmq

dsmq.start_server(host="127.0.0.1", port=30008)
```

### Add a message to a queue

As in `src/dsmq/example_put_client.py`

```python
from dsmq import dsmq

mq = dsmq.connect_to_server(host="127.0.0.1", port=12345)
topic = "greetings"
msg = "hello world!"
mq.put(topic, msg)
```

### Read a message from a queue

As in `src/dsmq/example_get_client.py`

```python
from dsmq import dsmq

mq = dsmq.connect_to_server(host="127.0.0.1", port=12345)
topic = "greetings"
msg = mq.get(topic)
```

### Demo

1. Open 3 separate terminal windows.
1. In the first, run `src/dsmq/dsmq.py`.
1. In the second, run `src/dsmq/example_put_client.py`.
1. In the third, run `src/dsmq/example_get_client.py`.

Alternative, if you're on Linux just run `src/dsmq/demo_linux.py`.

## How it works

### Expected behavior and limitations

- Many clients can read messages of the same topic. It is a one-to-many
pulication model.

- A client will not be able to read any of the messages that were put into
a queue before it connected.

- A client will get the oldest message available on a requested topic.
Queues are first-in-first-out.

- Put and get operations are fairly quick--less than 100 $`\mu`$s of processing
time plus any network latency--so it can comfortably handle operations at
hundreds of Hz. But if you try to have several clients reading and writing
at 1 kHz or more, you may overload the queue.

- The queue is backed by an in-memory SQLite database. If your message volumes
get larger than your RAM, you may reach an out-of-memory condition.


# API Reference
[[source](https://github.com/brohrer/dsmq/blob/main/src/dsmq/dsmq.py)]

### `start_server(host="127.0.0.1", port=30008)`

Kicks off the mesage queue server. This process will be the central exchange
for all incoming and outgoing messages.
- `host` (str), IP address on which the server will be visible and
- `port` (int), port. These will be used by all clients.
Non-privileged ports are numbered 1024 and higher.

### `connect_to_server(host="127.0.0.1", port=30008)`

Connects to an existing message queue server.
- `host` (str), IP address of the *server*.
- `port` (int), port on which the server is listening.
- returns a `DSMQClientSideConnection` object.

## `DSMQClientSideConnection` class

This is a convenience wrapper, to make the `get()` and `put()` functions
easy to write and remember

### `put(topic, msg)`

Puts `msg` into the queue named `topic`. If the queue doesn't exist yet, it is created.
- msg (str), the content of the message.
- topic (str), name of the message queue in which to put this message.

### `get(topic)`

Get the oldest eligible message from the queue named `topic`.
The client is only elgibile to receive messages that were added after it
connected to the server.
- `topic` (str)
- returns str, the content of the message. If there was no eligble message,
returns "".
